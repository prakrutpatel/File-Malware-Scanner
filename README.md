### Ubuntu Installation
In order to test the scripts please run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakrutpatel/OPSWAT.git && cd OPSWAT
chmod +x build.sh
```

Now we will be build the application by using your MetaDefender Cloud API Key. To find it visit [Portal OPSWAT](https://portal.opswat.com/)

```bash
#Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your personal key
./build.sh YOUR_API_KEY
